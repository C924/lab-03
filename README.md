## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 
REST optimizes client-server interactions with a statelessness approach where past requests aren't needed to determine a new state. This reduces load on the server.

Answer for Question 2:
The resources the server is supplying to the client can be images, videos, text, number, and any type of data.

Answer for Question 3:
We aren't using the PUT method in our mail server. We could add a PUT method that allows us to edit an email body or title in the list.

Answer for Question 4:
An API may restrict some or all of its methods to require API keys. It makes sense to use an API key in a project environment where anonymous traffic isn't a high priority. You can control the number of calls made to an API and identify usage patterns. If security is a concern, using RESTFUL API's shouldn't be used.
